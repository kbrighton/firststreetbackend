## Key Areas Needing Attention

### High Priority
1. **Architecture and Structure** (28.6% complete)
   - Progress made with error handling and service/repository layers
   - Still needs application factory pattern and better separation of concerns

2. **Testing** (0% complete)
   - No automated tests have been implemented
   - Critical for ensuring reliability as development continues

3. **Security** (25% complete)
   - Several critical security features are missing (password hashing, authorization checks)
   - Input validation and sanitization need to be implemented

### Medium Priority
1. **Database and Models** (50% complete)
   - Order model needs refactoring to reduce complexity
   - Data validation at the model level is missing

2. **Code Quality** (50% complete)
   - Missing docstrings and type hints
   - Potential N+1 query problems need to be addressed

3. **DevOps and Deployment** (12.5% complete)
   - Dockerfile needs improvements for security and efficiency
   - Monitoring, alerting, and backup procedures are missing

### Lower Priority
1. **Dependencies and Maintenance** (0% complete)
   - Dependency management needs improvement
   - Documentation for project architecture is missing

2. **Feature Enhancements** (0% complete)
   - User management features need implementation
   - Pagination, filtering, and export functionality are missing

3. **UI/UX Improvements** (0% complete)
   - UI modernization and responsiveness improvements needed
   - Accessibility features are missing

## Next Steps Recommendation
Based on the current status, it's recommended to focus on:

1. Implementing a proper application architecture with separation of concerns
2. Adding basic unit tests for existing functionality
3. Addressing the remaining security issues
4. Refactoring the database models for better maintainability

These steps will provide the foundation needed for further improvements and feature development.
