# Continuous Integration Implementation

## Overview

This change implements continuous integration (CI) for automated testing using GitHub Actions. The CI pipeline automatically runs unit tests and end-to-end tests whenever code is pushed to the main/master branch or when a pull request is created against these branches.

## Changes Made

1. Created a GitHub Actions workflow configuration file (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) that:
   - Sets up a Python 3.9 environment
   - Sets up a PostgreSQL 13 database for testing
   - Installs project dependencies
   - Runs unit tests using `run_tests.py`
   - Runs end-to-end tests using `run_e2e_tests.py`
   - Uploads test coverage reports as artifacts

2. Created documentation for the CI setup in `docs/ci_setup.md` that explains:
   - The CI pipeline overview
   - Configuration details
   - How to view test results
   - Maintenance instructions
   - Troubleshooting tips

## Benefits

1. **Automated Testing**: Tests are automatically run on every code change, ensuring that new changes don't break existing functionality.
2. **Early Detection of Issues**: Problems are detected early in the development process, making them easier and cheaper to fix.
3. **Consistent Testing Environment**: Tests are run in a consistent environment, reducing "works on my machine" issues.
4. **Visibility**: Test results are visible to all team members, promoting transparency and accountability.
5. **Documentation**: The CI setup is well-documented, making it easier for new team members to understand and maintain.

## Future Improvements

1. Add code quality checks (linting, formatting)
2. Implement security scanning for dependencies
3. Add deployment automation for staging/production environments
4. Set up notifications for failed builds
5. Add performance testing to the CI pipeline
