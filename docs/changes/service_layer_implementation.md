# Service Layer Implementation

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of a service layer between routes and models to encapsulate business logic, as specified in the pending tasks.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created Service Layer Structure
- Created a new `services` directory in the app package
- Added `__init__.py` to make it a proper Python package

### 2. Implemented Service Classes
- Created `OrderService` to handle order-related business logic
- Created `CustomerService` to handle customer-related business logic
- Created `UserService` to handle user-related business logic

### 3. Moved Business Logic from Routes to Services
- Moved order querying, filtering, and pagination logic to `OrderService`
- Moved order creation and update logic to `OrderService`
- Moved customer and user management logic to their respective service classes

### 4. Updated Routes to Use Service Layer
- Updated main routes to use `OrderService` instead of directly accessing the Order model
- Updated API routes to use `OrderService` for data fetching and updating
- Removed helper functions from routes as they've been moved to service classes

## Benefits
- **Separation of Concerns**: Routes now focus on HTTP request/response handling, while services handle business logic
- **Code Reusability**: Service methods can be reused across different routes
- **Testability**: Business logic in services can be tested independently of routes
- **Maintainability**: Changes to business logic can be made in one place without affecting routes

## Next Steps
- Implement a repository pattern for database access to further abstract data access logic
- Add proper error handling and custom error pages
- Implement logging throughout the application with proper log levels
