# Repository Pattern Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document provides a summary of the changes made to implement the repository pattern for database access in the FirstStreet Backend application.

## Changes Made

1. Created a new `repositories` directory in the `app` package to house all repository classes.
2. Implemented a `BaseRepository` abstract class that defines the common interface for all repositories.
3. Implemented concrete repositories for each model:
   - `UserRepository` for the `User` model
   - `CustomerRepository` for the `Customer` model
   - `OrderRepository` for the `Order` model
4. Updated the service layer to use the repositories instead of directly accessing the database:
   - `UserService` now uses `UserRepository`
   - `CustomerService` now uses `CustomerRepository`
   - `OrderService` now uses `OrderRepository`
5. Updated the Flask-Login user loader to use the `UserRepository`.
6. Created comprehensive documentation explaining the repository pattern implementation and how to use it.

## Benefits Achieved

- **Separation of Concerns**: Data access logic is now separated from business logic, making the code more maintainable.
- **Testability**: Services can now be tested in isolation by mocking repositories.
- **Flexibility**: The data source can be changed without affecting the business logic.
- **Maintainability**: Data access logic is centralized in repositories, making it easier to maintain.
- **Consistency**: A consistent interface is provided for data access operations across the application.
