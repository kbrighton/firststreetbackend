# Changes Made to the Project

## Security Improvements
1. Replaced hardcoded SECRET_KEY with environment variable in config.py
   - Added a fallback value for development environments
   - In production, set the SECRET_KEY environment variable to a secure random value

2. Enabled CSRF protection by setting WTF_CSRF_CHECK_DEFAULT to True in config.py
   - This helps protect against cross-site request forgery attacks

3. Added proper database connection configuration
   - Now uses SQLite as a fallback if DATABASE_URL environment variable is not set
   - In production, set the DATABASE_URL environment variable to your database connection string

## Code Quality Improvements
1. Added proper logging throughout the application
   - Replaced print statements with logger calls
   - Added different log levels (info, warning, error) for better debugging

2. Added proper error handling for database operations
   - Added try-except blocks around database operations
   - Added transaction rollback in case of errors
   - Added user feedback with flash messages

3. Added proper error handling for route functions
   - Added checks for when objects are not found
   - Added proper error responses with appropriate HTTP status codes

## Database Model Improvements
1. Fixed the dual primary key issue in Customer model
   - Changed CUSTID from primary_key to unique with an index

2. Implemented proper relationships between models
   - ~~Added a foreign key relationship from Order to Customer~~ (Removed due to missing data)
   - ~~Added a backref to allow easy access to orders from a customer~~ (Removed due to missing data)

3. Added created_at and updated_at timestamps to all models
   - These fields are automatically updated when records are created or modified

## How to Apply These Changes

### Database Migrations
The changes to the database models require migrations to be applied. Due to the complexity of the changes, it's recommended to:

1. Create a backup of your database
2. Run the following commands to apply the migrations:
   ```
   flask db migrate -m "Fix dual primary key in Customer, add relationships and timestamps"
   flask db upgrade
   ```

A new migration has been added to remove the foreign key relationship between Order and Customer due to missing data:
   ```
   flask db upgrade
   ```

If you encounter issues with the automatic migration, you may need to manually create a migration script or modify the generated one.

### Environment Variables
Make sure to set the following environment variables in your production environment:
- SECRET_KEY: A secure random string
- DATABASE_URL: Your database connection string

For development, these have fallback values, but it's still recommended to set them.

### Testing
After applying these changes, thoroughly test the application to ensure everything is working correctly, especially:
- User authentication
- Order creation and editing
- Customer management
- Search functionality

## Testing Improvements
1. Implemented end-to-end tests for critical user flows
   - Added tests for authentication flows (login, logout)
   - Added tests for order management flows (create, edit, view)
   - Added tests for search functionality (by customer, title, log)
   - Added a comprehensive test that simulates a complete user journey

2. Created helper functions for end-to-end testing
   - Added functions for login, logout, form submission, and content checking
   - These functions make it easier to write and maintain end-to-end tests

3. Added a script to run end-to-end tests
   - Created `run_e2e_tests.py` to run all end-to-end tests with a single command
   - The script provides a summary of test results

For more details, see [End-to-End Tests Implementation](changes/end_to_end_tests_implementation.md).

4. Added test coverage reporting
   - Added pytest-cov to requirements.txt
   - Created pytest.ini with coverage configuration
   - Updated run_tests.py and run_e2e_tests.py to generate coverage reports
   - Added coverage_reports/ to .gitignore
   - Created documentation for using test coverage reporting

For more details, see [Test Coverage Reporting](test_coverage.md) and [Test Coverage Implementation](changes/test_coverage_implementation.md).

5. Set up continuous integration for automated testing
   - Created a GitHub Actions workflow to automatically run tests on code changes
   - Configured the CI pipeline to run both unit tests and end-to-end tests
   - Set up test coverage reporting in the CI pipeline
   - Added documentation for the CI setup and maintenance

For more details, see [Continuous Integration Implementation](changes/ci_implementation.md).
