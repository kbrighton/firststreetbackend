"""
Services package for business logic.

This package contains service classes that encapsulate the business logic of the application.
Services act as an intermediary between the routes (controllers) and the repositories,
providing a layer of abstraction that separates business rules from data access logic.

Each service class is responsible for a specific domain entity (e.g., Order, Customer, User)
and provides methods for manipulating and querying those entities according to business rules.
